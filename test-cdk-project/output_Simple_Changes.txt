# Infrastructure Changes Summary

## 1. Executive Summary
This deployment introduces three new resources specifically within the 'SimpleStack' stack. It involves the creation of a S3 bucket and Lambda function. These changes will enhance our capabilities for data storage and processing. The business impact is minimal as these are standard additions with no modifications to existing resources.

## 2. Resource Changes

| Action | Resource Type | Resource Name | Stack |
|--------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| Create | AWS::S3::Bucket | SimpleStack/TestBucket | SimpleStack |
| Create | AWS::Lambda::Function | SimpleStack/TestFunction | SimpleStack |

## 3. Security & Permissions
The deployment doesn't specify any changes to IAM roles or policies. However, it is worth noting that the new S3 bucket and Lambda function, by default, will adhere to the principle of least privilege. We will need to explicitly define permissions for any access beyond the default.

## 4. Cost Impact
The new resources will have a minimal cost impact. The S3 bucket cost will depend on the amount of data stored, while the Lambda function cost will depend on the number of executions and execution time. Monitoring of costs post-deployment is recommended to ensure they align with expectations.

## 5. Risk Assessment
The risk level is low as there are no changes to existing resources, only additions. To further mitigate risk, we recommend thorough testing of these new resources to ensure they function as expected and do not disrupt existing services.

## 6. Deployment Notes
The deployment does not indicate any dependencies. The order of deployment should not impact functionality given the resources are independent. In case of any issues post-deployment, a rollback can be executed to remove the new resources.
