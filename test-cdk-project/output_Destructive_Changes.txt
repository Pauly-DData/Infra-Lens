# Infrastructure Changes Summary

## Executive Summary
This infrastructure change involves the destruction of the 'OldStack' and the creation of a new stack 'NewStack'. The 'OldStack' has two resources, an S3 Bucket and a Lambda Function, which will be deleted. In the new 'NewStack', a new S3 Bucket will be created. The business impact of this transition will depend on the contents of the old resources and the intended use of the new resources.

## Resource Changes

| Action | Resource Type | Resource Name | Stack |
|--------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| Delete | AWS::S3::Bucket | OldBucket | OldStack |
| Delete | AWS::Lambda::Function | OldFunction | OldStack |
| Create | AWS::S3::Bucket | NewBucket | NewStack |

## Security & Permissions
There are no explicit changes to IAM roles, policies, or other security settings in this diff. However, it's crucial to ensure that the new S3 bucket in 'NewStack' has the correct permissions and security configurations, maintaining the principle of least privilege. 

## Cost Impact
The cost impact of these changes will be moderate. We are deleting two resources (an S3 bucket and a Lambda Function) and creating a new S3 bucket. Depending on the usage and storage requirements of the new S3 bucket, there may be a slight increase or decrease in costs.

## Risk Assessment
The main risks involve data loss from the deletion of the old S3 bucket and potential disruption of any processes relying on the old Lambda function. Mitigation strategies include verifying any necessary data is backed up or transferred from the old S3 bucket before deletion, and ensuring that any processes previously handled by the old Lambda function are adequately handled in the new infrastructure.

## Deployment Notes
The order of deployment should proceed with the deletion of 'OldStack' and the creation of 'NewStack'. Dependencies to note include any services or processes that interact with the old S3 bucket or Lambda function. Rollback considerations should include a plan for restoring the old S3 bucket and Lambda function if necessary.
