# Infrastructure Changes Summary

## Executive Summary
This deployment will trigger major changes to our AWS infrastructure across three stacks, namely the SimpleStack, SecurityStack, and DatabaseStack. The changes encompass updates, replacements, and additions of resources. These modifications will have significant implications on our service delivery, security, and overall system performance. 

## Resource Changes

| Action | Resource Type | Resource Name | Stack |
|--------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| Update | S3 Bucket | `SimpleStack/TestBucket` | `SimpleStack` |
| Replace | Lambda Function | `SimpleStack/TestFunction` | `SimpleStack` |
| Create | DynamoDB Table | `SimpleStack/NewResource` | `SimpleStack` |
| Create | KMS Key | `SecurityStack/TestKey` | `SecurityStack` |
| Create | IAM Role | `SecurityStack/TestRole` | `SecurityStack` |
| Create | RDS DBInstance | `DatabaseStack/TestDatabase` | `DatabaseStack` |
| Create | RDS DBSubnetGroup | `DatabaseStack/TestSubnetGroup` | `DatabaseStack` |

## Security & Permissions
The new IAM Role created will need to be assigned appropriate permissions to ensure it can perform the intended tasks without compromising security. The KMS Key's usage and access should also be properly configured and monitored.

## Cost Impact
The seven new resources will add to our daily AWS cost. The replaced Lambda Function in the SimpleStack may alter the cost, depending on the nature of the update. Regular monitoring is recommended to ensure we stay within budget.

## Risk Assessment
The high-risk element in this deployment is the replacement of the Lambda Function, which could potentially impact dependent services. Pre-deployment testing and phased deployment are recommended to mitigate this risk.

## Deployment Notes
The order of deployment should consider dependencies between the resources. For rollback purposes, a snapshot of the current state should be taken before deployment. In the event of a failure, we can quickly revert to the previous state to minimize service disruption.
