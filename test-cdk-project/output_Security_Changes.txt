# Infrastructure Changes Summary

## Executive Summary
The proposed deployment will create a new Stack 'SecurityStack' and introduce 7 new resources into it. These changes will enhance our cloud security, provide a new VPC for network isolation, and pave the way for future development and scaling of our services.

## Resource Changes

| Action | Resource Type | Resource Name | Stack |
|--------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| Create | KMS Key | `SecurityStack/TestKey` | `SecurityStack` |
| Create | IAM Role | `SecurityStack/TestRole` | `SecurityStack` |
| Create | IAM Policy | `SecurityStack/TestPolicy` | `SecurityStack` |
| Create | SecretsManager Secret | `SecurityStack/TestSecret` | `SecurityStack` |
| Create | EC2 VPC | `SecurityStack/TestVpc` | `SecurityStack` |
| Create | EC2 SecurityGroup | `SecurityStack/TestSecurityGroup` | `SecurityStack` |

## Security & Permissions

Several security and permission changes are involved in this deployment:

- A new KMS Key is being created for encryption and decryption purposes.
- An IAM Role is being created which will allow specific services to assume it and perform actions.
- An IAM Policy is being created which will dictate what actions are allowed and on which resources.
- A Secrets Manager Secret is being created to securely store sensitive data.
- A new Security Group is being created, which will act as a virtual firewall, controlling inbound and outbound traffic for associated Amazon EC2 instances.

## Cost Impact

The new resources will add to the ongoing costs. However, as these are mainly security and networking resources, the increase is expected to be minimal. It is recommended to monitor AWS billing reports post-deployment to understand the cost implication better.

## Risk Assessment

The potential risks associated with this change are minimal as these are standard AWS resources. However, as always, there is a potential for misconfiguration which could lead to security vulnerabilities. It is recommended that the IAM policies and Security Group rules be reviewed and tested thoroughly.

## Deployment Notes

The dependencies in this deployment are minimal, with the resources being largely independent of each other. The deployment should be straightforward, but as always it is recommended to deploy in a staging environment first. In case of any issues, all resources are new and can be deleted without affecting existing infrastructure.
