# Infrastructure Changes Summary

## 1. Executive Summary
This deployment will introduce significant changes to our cloud infrastructure, with the creation of a new stack, 'RealCdkTestStack', and the addition of 7 new resources within the stack. These changes will support enhanced data storage, user management, function execution, and logging capabilities, which should consequently improve our application's performance and reliability.

## 2. Resource Changes Table
| Action | Resource Type | Resource Name | Stack |
|--------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| Create | AWS::S3::Bucket | DataBucket | RealCdkTestStack |
| Create | AWS::DynamoDB::Table | UserTable | RealCdkTestStack |
| Create | AWS::IAM::Role | LambdaExecutionRole | RealCdkTestStack |
| Create | AWS::IAM::Policy | LambdaExecutionRoleDefaultPolicy | RealCdkTestStack |
| Create | AWS::Lambda::Function | TestFunction | RealCdkTestStack |
| Create | AWS::Logs::LogGroup | TestFunctionLogGroup | RealCdkTestStack |

## 3. Security & Permissions
A new IAM role 'LambdaExecutionRole' will be created which may have its own security permissions and policies. The 'LambdaExecutionRoleDefaultPolicy' will also be added. It's crucial to review these IAM policies and permissions to ensure they provide the necessary access without compromising security.

## 4. Cost Impact
This deployment will introduce new resources that contribute to AWS service costs. These include a new S3 bucket, a DynamoDB table, a Lambda function, an IAM role, an IAM policy, and a Log Group. Each of these services can incur costs based on usage, so it's vital to monitor these resources post-deployment to keep track of the actual cost impact.

## 5. Risk Assessment
The primary risk associated with this deployment revolves around the IAM role and policy creation, as improper configurations may lead to security vulnerabilities. To mitigate this, we should ensure thorough reviews of IAM permissions and conduct proper testing before deployment. 

## 6. Deployment Notes
The deployment order should consider resource dependencies. For instance, the IAM role should be created before the Lambda function that would assume this role. Any errors during deployment should trigger a rollback to the previous state to maintain system stability. 

Please note that this is a high-level overview, and additional considerations may be required based on the specific configurations and business requirements.
