# Infra-Lens

My general goal is to make complex things as simple as possible ‚Äî so here we go.

According to Claude.ai (and myself), this project can be summarized as:

A professional, modular GitHub Action that automatically summarizes infrastructure changes using AI, making infrastructure changes easier to understand for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Sometimes, you just want simple words and short sentences to explain what‚Äôs happening during CDK deploys ‚Äî with a little help from our AI friends.

This project grew out of my journey learning AWS, IaC, and CloudFormation ‚Äî and the realization that certain changes (like updates to deprecated APIs) can unexpectedly break your cloud stack. It‚Äôs designed as an add-on to your workflow, helping anyone ‚Äî even with limited time or technical background ‚Äî quickly understand infrastructure changes to your cloud.

## Quick Start

### 1. Add the Action to Your Workflow

```yaml

  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  summarize-diff:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

### `json`
JSON format with metadata and structured data:
```json
{
  "summary": "Markdown summary content",
  "metadata": {
    "generator": "CDK Diff Summarizer",
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01 12:00:00 UTC"
  },

```markdown
## Infrastructure Changes Summary

### New Resources Being Created
- **S3 Bucket (MyBucket)**: A new storage bucket for application data
- **Lambda Function (MyFunction)**: Serverless function for processing data
- **IAM Roles & Policies**: Security permissions for the Lambda function

### Business Impact

- **Security**: Enhanced with proper IAM roles
- **Scalability**: Serverless architecture allows automatic scaling

### Potential Risks
- **Data Storage**: Ensure proper backup and retention policies
- **Permissions**: Review IAM policies for least privilege access
```
